ITKSnap - branched...

This is a branch of the main ITKSnap code... wanted to add some custom features.

As of right now, here they are:

 - vector visualization over a slice (vector overlay).

Build instructions:
 - This is branched from this version of ITKSnap: itksnap-2.2.0-20110504-source.tar.gz
 - Same build instructions as ITKSnap, I use these ITK/VTK versions:
 - ITK 3.20.1
 - VTK 5.6.1
 - (the snap code doesn't seem to be compatible with newer versions, as of this version).


Warning: I've tried to do things the right way, but a few things are hacks, as I mostly needed it working quick.
